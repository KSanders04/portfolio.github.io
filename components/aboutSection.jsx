            I'm a computer science student at Ball State University expecting to
            graduate in May 2026. My main focus is on web and mobile development
            as well as cybersecurity. I not only love making web and mobile apps
            look good but also ones that load fast, are accessible, and writing
            maintainable code.
            <br />
            <br />
            When I am not writing code, I have a huge passion for cars, working
            out, and going on hikes. I am looking for new opportunities to apply
            my skills, grow as a software developer, and work on meaningful,
            impactful projects.
